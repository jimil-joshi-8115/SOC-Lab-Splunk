# 🛡️ SOC Level 1 — Splunk Home Lab

> A hands-on SOC L1 home lab built to practice real-world threat detection, log analysis, and incident investigation using Splunk SIEM.

---

## 👨‍💻 About This Project

This repository documents my SOC Level 1 home lab where I simulate attacks on my own machine and use **Splunk** to detect, investigate, and report on them — just like a real SOC analyst would.

**Tools Used:**
- Splunk Enterprise (local)
- Windows Security Event Logs
- Windows PowerShell Operational Logs
- MITRE ATT&CK Framework

## 🧪 Lab 9 — Windows Firewall Disabled

### What I Did
- Disabled Windows Firewall using PowerShell `Set-NetFirewallProfile`
- Used Splunk Event ID 4104 as alternative detection (Event ID 4950 requires additional log configuration)
- Detected exact firewall disable command in PowerShell logs
- Documented limitation and recommended production solution
- Re-enabled firewall immediately after detection

### Detection Note
> Event ID 4950 requires Windows Firewall Advanced Security log source. As an alternative, PowerShell Script Block Logging (Event ID 4104) was used to detect the firewall modification command. In a production SOC environment, both should be monitored together.

### SPL Query
```spl
index=main EventCode=4104
| search Message="*NetFirewall*" OR Message="*Enabled False*" OR Message="*Enabled True*"
| table _time, ComputerName, Message
| sort -_time
| head 20
```

### Result
Splunk detected **74 firewall-related PowerShell events** on host `JIMIL-JOSHI` including `Set-NetFirewallProfile -Profile Domain,Public,Private -Enabled False`.
